# trainBooking


Connecting to the database:
1) sqlite-jdbc-3.49.1.0.jar 
- already included in repo so ignore next two bullets!
- downloaded from https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/releases under "Assets"
- this .jar file should be in this project/workspace folder
2) train_booking.db database file should be in the project folder as well



To compile and run the code (since the run button on the top right doesn't work for some reason):
- javac -cp ".:sqlite-jdbc-3.49.1.0.jar" {fileName}.java
- java -cp ".:sqlite-jdbc-3.49.1.0.jar" {fileName}
